# python-word-counter
A python word counter, counts words in text files


### Objective ###

Create a simple application that takes a UTF-8 plain-text file as input and outputs:

* Total number of words in text file

* Ten most common words and number of occurrences for each

You application should be run from the command line using a single command. For example:

    $	python ./word_counter.py input.txt

Please include a test suite (tests.py) demonstrating the correctness of your solution and a README file clearly explaining how to build, run and test your application. 
DO NOT use `collections.Counter` or any built in sorting for this, please define your own counter class instead. Please use python3 and best practices (PEP-8) to write your solution. Please include an explanation of your solution and any assumptions you made. Using an IDE like PyCharm is recommended, but not required.


### Usage ###

Run the main 'word_counter.py' file:

    ./word_counter.py samples/test1.txt


### Tests ###

Run the 'tests.py' test suite file:

    ./tests.py
